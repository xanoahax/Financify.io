# Changelog

All notable changes for desktop releases are documented here.  
Each release must have a matching section (`## vX.Y.Z`) so GitHub release notes and the in-app update dialog stay in sync.

## v0.9.51
- Added multi-profile support with profile-specific local storage and IndexedDB separation.
- Added first-start setup flow (onboarding) before entering the dashboard.
- Added profile setup options during onboarding: profile name plus optional PIN/password protection.
- Added profile management in Settings, including post-setup protection updates via Edit Profile.
- Added controlled onboarding exit for newly added profiles while keeping first-start onboarding non-exitable.
